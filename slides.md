# Overview

- Simple example REST api we'll testing
- Property testing
    - QuickCheck vs. hedgehog
- State machine testing (SMT)
- Hedgehog SMT prerequisites
    - higher kinded polymorphism
- Example code + live coding SMT tests


# Example REST api

- Our system under test
- A simple servant based application with 3 endpoints
    1. GET /projects - get list of projects
    2. POST /projects - create a project (returning ID of create project)
    3. DELETE /projects/PROJECT_ID - delete a project
- see `src/App` in this repo


# Property testing - key concepts

- Generate **random inputs**
- Assert that function under tests satisfies some property for all generated inputs
- When input is found that doesn't satisfy the property, try to **shrink** it to provide minimal counterexample


# Property testing

## Advantages (vs. unit testing)

- better coverage with fewer tests written
- better at discovering edge cases/unexpected feature interactions
- forces you to think about more abstractly about desired system properties

## Disadvantages

- not always easy to come up with useful properties
- need to control the distribution of generated random values


# Property testing in Haskell

- Two most popular libraries
[QuickCheck](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck) and [Hedgehog](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hedgehog)
- QuickCheck is the original property testing library by John Hughes
    - state machine testing provided by separate library [quickcheck-state-machine](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/quickcheck-state-machine)
- Hedgehog is more recent
    - integrated skrinking
    - beautiful output with color highlighted code
    - state machine testing support as part of base library


# State machine testing (SMT)

- A way to apply property testing to impure code / external system
- The test maintains a simplified model of the state of the tested system
    - e.g. list of users, projects created
- The test generates random sequence of actions that can depend on state
- The test executes generated actions one by one
- The test verifies after each action, that various post-conditions are met
    - e.g. HTTP api returns 200 status reponse
    - If I rename resource to X, it's named X when I get it the next time


# State machine testing - Key Requirements

1. action generation should be aware of the system state
    - e.g. generate action to delete resource only if it exists
2. random input generation must be deterministic
    - reproducibility if test fails!
    ```
    This failure can be reproduced by running:
    > recheck (Size 2) (Seed 184616 79431) prop_api_tests
    ```
3. sequences of actions must be shrinkable
    - goal: given long sequence of actions reproducing bug,
    find a shorter sequence that still reproduces the bug


# State machine testing - Key Requirements

- How can we generate **random** sequence of actions that depend on each other (e.g. output of one action is used as input for next action) yet is still **deterministic**??

- Ingenious idea:
   - separate phases of **random input generation** and **action execution**
   - During test generation dependencies between actions are expressed using symbolic variables
   - During test execution symbolic variables are replaced by actual values returned by the tested system

# Example input actions generated by the test

```
Var 0 = DeleteNonExistentProjectInput []
Var 1 = CreateProjectInput "Xg"
Var 2 = DeleteExistigProjectInput (Var 1)
Var 3 = GetProjectsInput
Var 4 = CreateProjectInput "GI"
Var 5 = DeleteExistigProjectInput (Var 4)
Var 6 = CreateProjectInput "GA6FX"
Var 7 = CreateProjectFailNameExistsInput "GA6FX"
Var 8 = DeleteNonExistentPr9jectInput [ Var 6 ]
```

# Aside: Higher kinded polymorphism

- concrete types
    - no type variables
    - `Maybe Int`, `[String]`, `(Double, Bool)`
- "normal" polymorphic types
    - type variables have kind `Type`
    - `Maybe a`, `[b]`, `(c,d)`
    - intuition: container that can hold different types of things
- higher kinded polymorphism
    - type variables have more complex kinds
    - `f` in `f Int` has kind `Type -> Type`
    - familiar example: `Functor`, `Applicative`, `Monad` are all
    parametrized by type variable of kind `Type -> Type`
    - intuition: functions that can work with different types of containers (think `fmap`, `traverse`)


# Higher kinded polymorphism

- The main point: you can have a datatype which is parametrized
by a higher kinded type (like a container)

```haskell
> data Something (container :: Type -> Type) 
     = Something (container Int)
> :t Something (Just 1)
Something (Just 1) :: Something Maybe
> :t Something [1]
Something [1] :: Something []
```

# What is that `Var` thing?

- `newtype Var a v = Var (v a)`
    - *Variables are the potential or actual result of executing an action.*
    - *They are parameterised by either `Symbolic` or `Concrete` depending on the phase of the test.*

- `Var ProjectId Symbolic`
    - is symbolic representation of `ProjectId` used during test input generation
    - we don't yet know what `ProjectId` the application will return when the action is executed
    - but we need something to be able to create dependencies between actions

- `Var ProjectId Concrete`
    - is concrete representation of `ProjectId` used during test execution
    - can get actual `ProjectId` value out of it (e.g. to call `deleteProject projId`)


# Vars are used in State and Input

- You declare your custom `data State` to represent the state of tested system
- For each action you'd like to execute you declare `(Action)Input`
    - represents randomly generated input data 
    - used as input for actions that are executed against tested application

- Both `State` and `Input` types have to be parametrized by `v :: Type -> Type`
- Both `State` and `Input` can contain pure data that we generated during tests,
as well as references to values returned by external system.
- in our example app
    - When you `createProject` it returns `ProjectId`
    - If you want to store this value in `State` you must wrap it in `Var ProjectId v`


# Skeleton state machine test

```haskell
prop_api_tests :: Property
prop_api_tests = property $ do
    let commands =
            [ command1
            , command2
            , ...
            ]
    -- Generate random sequence of 1 - 100 actions
    -- starting from initialState
    actions <- forAll $ Gen.sequential
        (Range.linear 1 100) initialState commands
    executeSequential initialState actions
```


# Command - overview

- the key abstraction when writing state machine tests
- one command represents one action that hedgehog can try to run against the tested system

# Command skeleton

```haskell
someCommand :: Command gen test state
someCommand = Command
    commandGen      -- 1. when/how to generate inputs?
    commandExecute  -- 2. how to execute input?
    [ Require (...) -- 3. preconditions
    , Update (...)  -- 4. how to update the model?
    , Ensure (...)  -- 5. assertions - what must be true
                    -- after command executed?
    ]
```

# Command parts (1) - Input generator

- `inputGenerator :: state Symbolic -> Maybe (gen (input Symbolic))`

- We're given current state (with Sybmolic vars) and we have to decide:
    - does it make sense to generate the input for this command in this state?
    - if not, we return Nothing
    - if yes, we return Just a generator (that can pick some values in the state)

- example: to generate "Delete project" command we need at leat 1+ project in the state
- the generator can pick random project from the state and return `DeleteProjectInput projectIdVar`

# Command parts (2) - execution function

`commandExecute :: input Concrete -> m output`

- Given concrete input, execute it (against the tested out) and get the output
- The output can be used to change our model (e.g. add new `ProjectId` to the model)

# Command parts (3) - Require callback

`state Symbolic -> input Symbolic -> Bool`

- Given this state, does it still make sense to execute this input?
- Used when shrinking
    - after we remove some actions from the sequence, followup actions might no longer make sense

# Command parts (4) - Update callback

`forall v. Ord1 v => state v -> input v -> Var output v -> state v`

- How to update the state after the command is executed
- this is perhaps the hardest one to crack, because it must be 
polymorphic in the `v` argument - i.e. it must work the same for `Symbolic` as well as for `Concrete` variables

# Command parts (5) - Ensure callback

`state Concrete -> state Concrete -> input Concrete -> output -> Test ()`

- After each action is executed we're given access to
    - state before the action
    - state after the action
    - input for the action
    - output of the action
- we can do whatever assertions using these values
